 Mandelbrot Fractal Generator - C++ Project from "Learn Advance C++ Programming" Course on Udemy



<h5> This C++ project is a Mandelbrot fractal generator created as part of the "Learn Advance C++ Programming" course on Udemy. It utilizes the mathematical principles of Mandelbrot fractals to generate colorful fractal images. Throughout the course, I learned how to work with colors, Pixel-level operations, by manipulating individual pixels, I acquired a deeper understanding of image processing and the power of low-level operations. </h5>

<h5> I plan to enhance this project by implementing zooming functionality. This will allow users to interactively explore different regions of the Mandelbrot fractal and observe its intricate details. </h5>
